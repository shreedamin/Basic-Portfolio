            <p> 
                My passion for problem solving and effective communication skills has fueled my drive to break into the criminal justice
                system. A recent graduate, I have had the opportunity to gain real-world experience during my internship
                with New Hanover Emergency Management. I supported their 911/EMT services as well as the Sheriffs office
                and Medical Trauma Services. I participated in many emergency response drills and exercises, assisted in
                writing and updating emergency plans, and created a long-term recovery plan. The best part of that experience
                was that I was able to participate in many agencies and learn about what makes each one different.
            </p>
            
            <p> 
                With the skills from my internship I was able to make a career move into the Transportation Security Administration
                working as a Transportation Security Officer and Training Coach. I supported TSA in many security operations
                and with the training of new recruits. I also developed a way to track, test and improve new technology ie
                pilot programs to improve security and efficiency.
            </p>
            <p> My skill set has also evolved to include a lot with technology. Currently, I’m managing my own startup company.
                My team is building a social networking app exclusively for college students, and I have designed the app
                from the bottom up. In addition, I’ve built the website and created all graphic design elements. I enjoy
                stretching my mind and extending my skillset into unfamiliar territory to supplement my formal education.
                I’m also looking to expand my professional network as I hope to advance my law enforcement career , so please
                don’t hesitate to connect with me!
